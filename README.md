# Motivation
Teach myself godot and C#, and learn about rendering too

# Inspiration
[Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague)'s [Procedural Planet Generation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8) YouTube series.

His tutorials are in Unity, so porting them to godot is somewhat involved and requires me to have a full understanding of the concepts he explains.

# Expansion Ideas
I think it would be cool to compile into web assembly and make a GitHub pages site demonstrating how this works...

I'm not sure how viable this is (performance wise) and it would require more research
